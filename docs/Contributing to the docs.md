# Contributing to the Docs
You can contribute to the docs if you want to, but mostly the digital portfolio itself will be kept private for privacy reasons. 

Just make sure to: 

- Make a clone of this repo

- Start this up on MkDocs 

- Load in all requirements and dependencies (check requirements.txt)
