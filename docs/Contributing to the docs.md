# Contributing to the Docs
You can contribute to the docs if you want to, but mostly the digital portfolio itself will be kept private for privacy reasons. 

Just make sure to: 

- Make a clone of this repo

- Start this up on MkDocs 

- Load in all requirements and dependencies (check requirements.txt)

## Getting Started

Dependencies: Python 3 (3.6 and above), Mkdocs, and Pip


1. First install mkdocs by running `pip install mkdocs`

2. cd to the folder that you want it to have the docs in and run `git clone https://github.com/No767/Project-Deltaline-Docs.git` 

3. run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in order to install the dependency within the requirements.txt file

4. Edit the files as needed and if you want to check how it looks, run `mkdocs serve`

5. Once it's all done, deploy it to Read the Docs by pushing it to the GitHub repository.
