# Django Framework

Deltaline uses Django in order to make thing go a lot faster, and add in features that something like JS or React would have. Django is a lib written in Python designed to accelerate loading speeds, and be secure and scalable. This allows me or any other contributor to add in features like a comment section, animations, and a ton more. I have been learning Python, since this language can be used from Discord Bots (making one rn, which is the Rin bot), machine learning and AI, to webapps like these.
