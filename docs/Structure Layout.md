# Structure Layout
This site is layed out in a way so it splits into multiple pages (or html files). This way, it doesn't overload netifly with a bunch of pages and keeps it mostly lag-free. iframes will still have to used since both Seesaw and Adobe Spark don't have API's that i can use Python (or js, but i haven't learned js yet) to hook into. But hopefully it shouldn't be a ton of lag if built correctly. If you want to suggest something to change, just make a pr and if u want to change the actual content itself, contact me first

This is meant to show some of the better works out of the bunch. Only 5-7 will be selected out of the 20.

Also there is a docker image for the index.html, which runs off of Nginx and Docker
