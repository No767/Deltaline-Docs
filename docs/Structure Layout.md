# Structure Layout
This site is layed out in a way so it spilts into multiple pages (or html files). This way, it doesn't overload netifly with a bunch of pages and keeps it mostly lag-free. iframes will still have to used since both Seesaw and Adobe Spark don't have API's that i can use Python (or js, but i haven't learned js yet) to hook into. But hopefully it shouldn't be a ton of lag if built correctly. If you want to suggest something to change, just make a pr and if u want to change the actual content itself, contact me first

Each page will have 5 entries, and will be spilt into 4 pages. More will be added later on
