### Issues with the Digital Portfolio

The digital portfolio (Project Deltaline) is hosted on Google Sites. Now, it's meant as a static webpage, but when you add tons of hd assets, and tons of iframes and html code; it starts to lag. 
This is due to Google's Sites inefficient loading speeds and useless JS code. And the litmiations that google sites has doesn't allow me to use the Bootstrap lib, or use .svg or .webp files for faster load times. For more detail, please look at Issues with the Digital Portfolio page [jere](https://no767.github.io/Project-Deltaline-Docs/Loadtimes/)
